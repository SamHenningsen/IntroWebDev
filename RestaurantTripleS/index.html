                        Sam's Savory Saloon is a family owned restaurant dating back to 1952. Named after the founder, Sam Wilson,
                        the Saloon originated as a Texas Style restaurant based on Sam's roots in Austin, Texas. The
                        food quickly changed after the only American Style restaurant in Anchorage burned down in 1953. 
                        Sam's culinary expertise and desire to please his customers drove this abrupt change as people
                        craved American Style food.

                        In memory of Sam, we have continued to use the name, and always put our customer's first. Because
                        of this, we take the suggestions of our customers and offer the top three sought after meals on the
                        first Friday of every month.
